# Jhoot
A program to determine if your USB/SD card or other storage device has the capacity you think it does

A simple program to determine if a storage medium has the storage capacity that it claims to have...

Features
- Minimal, doesn't require any external dependencies (other than python)
- Single file, easy to carry around
- Multithreaded, meaning your drive can work at its full capacity (for a faster test)
- Custom fragmentation, so that any partitioning method can be checked


If you have any ideas for extending the functionality of this program, get in touch!

> Currently a Work In Progress!! (not ready for usage)
